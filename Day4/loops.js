/* loops */

/* Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.
 Conditions typically return true or false when analysed.
  A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false  */

/* There are basically two types of loops in most computer programming languages,
   namely, entry controlled loops and exit controlled loops. */
